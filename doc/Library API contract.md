# General

Transport Library RFC style documentation, this document describes the binding provided from the transport library to the KIARA upper layers.

## Language

API must be in C99.

The implementation may be in C++11, without GNU or clang or MSVC extensions, do not use std::thread; or in C99.

All code must be able to be built with GCC, clang and MSVC.

Use as little third party libraries as possible (Boost) to keep the number of dependencies as low as possible.

## Memory handling

The code allocating memory is also responsible to free it.

If you cannot ensure this, you MUST provide a struct with a function freeing the memory.

```
struct foo {
	void *ptr;
	void free_foo(foo *to_be_freed);
}

â€¦

foo.free_foo (foo);
free (foo);
```

# Constructs

## kt_conn_session_t

```
typedef struct kt_conn_session {
	kt_conn_session_info* _info;
	void* k_user_data;
} kt_conn_session_t;
```

## kt_msg_t

```
typedef struct kt_msg {
	std::map <std::string, std::string> metadata;
	void* payload;
	std::size_t payload_size;
	void (*free_payload) (void*);
} kt_msg_t;
```

## kt_connconf_t

```
enum kt_network_layer {
	IPLEGACY,
	IPV6
};

enum kt_transport_layer {
	TCP,
	UDP,
	DCCP,
	SCTP
};

/* TODO: This needs some more fine tuning like setting the protocol level,
 * desired algorithms, key exchanges etc.
 * <habl> 21.08.2013
 */
enum kt_crypto_layer {
	NONE,
	TLS,
	SSL
};

enum kt_application_layer {
	ZEROMQ,
	HTTP,
	RTSP,
	NTP,
	FTP,
	NFS
};

struct kt_network_stack_t {
	enum kt_network_layer network;
	enum kt_transport_layer transport;
	enum kt_crypto_layer crypto;
	enum kt_application_layer application;
	uint16_t port;
};

/* The application type directly decides the communication pattern of the
 * socket and network and transport layers. Also it makes certain assumptions
 * that for e.g. a webserver implies HTTP with TCP on Port 80 and a streaming
 * service uses RTSP and UDP on port 554.
 */
typedef enum kt_application_type {
	WEBSERVER,
	PUBLISHER,
	STREAM,
	ROUNDROBIN,
	REQUESTREPLY
} kt_application_type;

typedef struct {
	struct kt_network_stack_t network_config;
	enum kt_application_type type;
	char *base_url;
} kt_connconf_t;
```

## remote endpoint

A valid remote endpoint may look like "tcp://192.168.1.1:1234" or "dds://foobar.tld:6666" and is of type char*.

The EBNF:

```
/* http://railroad.my28msec.com/rr/ui for nice railroad diagrams */
remote-endpoint ::= (protocol)? url port
protocol ::= ( "http" | "tcp"  | "udp" | "dds" )?
url ::= ( ip | hostname )
ip ::=  ipnumblock ":" ipnumblock ":" ipnumblock ":" ipnumblock ":" ipnumblock ":" ipnumblock ":" ipnumblock ":" ipnumblock
ipnumblock ::= hex hex hex hex
hostname ::= ialpha (. hostname )?
port ::= "1".."65535"

xalpha ::= (alpha | digit | safe | extra | escape)
xalphas ::= xalpha ( xalphas )?
xpalpha ::= (xalpha | "+")
xpalphas ::= xpalpha ( xpalphas )?
ialpha ::= alpha ( xalphas )?
digits ::= digit ( digits )?
safe ::= ("$" | "-" | "_" | "@" | "." | "&" | "+" | "-")
extra ::= ("!" | "*" | '"' | "'" | "(" | ")" | ",")
escape ::= "%" hex hex
hex ::= (digit | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F")

```

# Client

## connect

Connect the client to a remote server

`connect` requires a valid remote endpoint description according to its transport stack.

The `connect` must return a kt_conn_session and NULL on failure.

## send

Send data to the remote host

`send` requires a kt_conn_session and a reference to a kt_msg.

The `send` shall queue the message for delivery and must delete the kt_msg object if the delivery was successful.

## recv

Receive data from the remote host

`recv` requires a kt_conn_session.

The `recv` must return a reference to a kt_msg or NULL if there was no data received. The developper has now control over the returned kt_msg and must destroy the received kt_msg object.

## disconnect

Disconnects the client from a remote server.

`disconnect` requires a kt_conn_session.

The `disconnect` shall close the connection and destroy the kt_conn_session object, though it is the duty of the developer to destroy/free kt_conn_session.k_user_data object.

# Server

## kiara_init_server

Configure the requirements for the server, it negotiates the subjacent protocols.

## KiaraRegisterHandle

Register a callback for handling an incoming message.

## KiaraRunServer

Launch the server and run it.

## KiaraStopServer

Stop the server and destroy all associated memory.
